Hi Dear Pavel,

You know I love you, right? Theses days I always feel stomachache and I can felt there is a knot in my stomach when I put my hands on my belly. I thought I just need some exercises but this lasts for about 3 months. And these days, after we made love, I felt much ache. So I prepared to check in hospital this weekend. But this morning, at about 5 am, I back to the bed after I had a pee, I couldnot get to sleep again, ep I got the knot so clearly and felt ache when I touched the knot. So I check the doctor, whose name and work time, I met last time I went to Shuguang Hospital. At the begining, I prepared to go hospital on weekend, then I don't need to ask for a leave. Consider of she only on work on Wensday, I will go to hospital tommorrow. I don't know the results will be. But the Holy mother Mary tell me "Don't worry", I know she will take care of me. I'm not afraid. Actually, I didn't want to go hospital, but I heard Jesus told me to go hospital. I checked with him several times, the same answer. So I will go like he told me. I asked for his help everyday. I know he will take care of me and us. 

Just let you know it.

Love you.

Yawei
